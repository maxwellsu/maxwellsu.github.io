### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves visualizing data to uncover potential associations, interpreting it, and building hypothesis and models from the data. Using EDA, large amounts of data can be simplified through summarization and reducing dimensions. Then, the data can be used to form the basis for hypothsesis testing. Plots, PCA (Principal Components Analysis) and 5-number summaries are usefull tools in EDA.

When I perform EDA, one of the methods I tend to employ is to plot each variable against each other in order to quickly identify associations, correlations, and variables of intertest.
